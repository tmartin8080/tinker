# Testing Fundamentals

## Why bother Testing?

> A problem well-stated is half solved. - Charles Kettering

1. *Documentation*: Testing defines problems, and verifies solutions are correct.
2. *Confidence*: Testing gives us confidence that our code works as expected.
3. *Prevent Regressions*: Testing can prevent breaking changes.

## Testing Goals

- prove that your code does what it's supposed to
- prevent breaking changes (regressions)
- make it easy to find where your code is broken
- write the least amount of test code possible

## Anatomy of a Test

Tests no matter how complicated are comprised of no more than 4 stages:

- setup
- exercise
- verify
- teardown

There are tests that may only use a few of these stages, and sometimes the order
isn't straightforward, but every test can be broken down into these stages.
